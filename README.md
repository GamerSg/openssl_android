# openssl_android
Makefile for building openssl android using llvm
Tested working on all versions of Android 4.3+

# Building Open Source Projects Using Standalone Toolchains

Given this example toolchain:

# Create an arm64 API 26 libc++ toolchain.
$NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py \
  --arch arm64 \
  --api 26 \
  --stl=libc++ \
  --install-dir=my-toolchain

Here's how you'd set up your environment to use it to build a traditional open source project:

# Add the standalone toolchain to the search path.
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/my-toolchain/bin

# Tell configure what tools to use.
target_host=aarch64-linux-android
export AR=$target_host-ar
export AS=$target_host-clang
export CC=$target_host-clang
export CXX=$target_host-clang++
export LD=$target_host-ld
export STRIP=$target_host-strip

# Tell configure what flags Android requires.
export CFLAGS="-fPIE -fPIC"
export LDFLAGS="-pie"

As an example, here's how to build toybox after performing the previous steps:

git clone https://github.com/landley/toybox.git
cd toybox
make defconfig && make

Alternatively a configure-based project would look more like this:

./configure && make
